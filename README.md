## Sitemap UI for WordPress 5.5+

WordPress 5.5 includes built-in [sitemap functionality](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/22/new-xml-sitemaps-functionality-in-wordpress-5-5/).

This plugin provides a UI for some of the most common configuration settings.

**NOTE:** some plugins (like Yoast SEO) replace core sitemaps with their own version. This plugin only works with core sitemaps.

### Features

* Turn off WP core sitemaps entirely
* Exclude all (or specific) post types
* Exclude all (or specific) taxonomies
* Exclude taxonomy terms by ID
* Exclude post items by ID
* Exclude all users
